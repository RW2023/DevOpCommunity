Welcome to the DevOps community! We are a beginner-friendly coding community that aims to provide a welcoming environment for learners to practice the fundamentals of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our community members work on collaborative projects and practice Git and GitHub version control.

## Features

- Study resources: Our community features a range of study resources to help learners improve their coding skills, including video tutorials, blog posts, and online courses.
- Connect with other learners: We provide a platform for learners to connect with each other, find study buddies, and receive code reviews.
- Collaborative projects: Our community members work together on a variety of coding projects, ranging from simple static web pages to complex web applications.

## Our First Community-Wide Project

This repository is our first community-wide project, and we invite everyone in the DevOps community to contribute. The project involves building a simple web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We encourage learners of all skill levels to participate in this project, as it will provide an opportunity to practice their coding skills and work collaboratively with other learners.
